Summary: 
Sprint 3 marked the final stages of the project, where most of the development work was completed, and the team focused on debugging, testing, and preparing for the project deadline. Key achievements include finishing User Story 7, completing Docker containerization, and running final tests to ensure quality. Despite some scheduling confusion (with the initial misunderstanding of the deadline), the team quickly adapted, and all features were completed, with final testing running smoothly.

Action Items: 
Have a final retrospective meeting with the team to discuss the end of the project
