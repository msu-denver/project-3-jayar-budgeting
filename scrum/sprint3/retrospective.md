# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 12/6/2024 - 8:00pm

Participants: Yedani Mendoza Gurrola, Artem Marsh, Jose Gomez Betancourt, Alexander Gonzalez Ramirez, Rhodes Ferris

What Went Well:
User Stories 7 and 8 were completed on time, providing important features for the app. This allowed the team to move on to testing and debugging without any major delays.
The team worked well together, even with some unexpected schedule changes (like the project deadline change). Everyone adapted quickly, especially with the Docker issue and the requirement validation. Team members were proactive in communicating and assisting each other with tasks.

What Could Be Improved:
There was some confusion regarding the projectâ€™s due date, initially thinking it was due on the 8th instead of the 6th. This led to some last-minute adjustments in the sprint plan. Better clarity around deadlines earlier in the sprint would help avoid unnecessary stress and ensure the team is fully prepared.

Action Items for Future Projects: Document final project insights and best practices to support continuous improvement.
