# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 11/25/2024 - 8:00pm

Participants: Yedani Mendoza Gurrola, Artem Marsh, Jose Gomez Betancourt, Alexander Gonzalez Ramirez, Rhodes Ferris

What went well: 
The team communicated effectively throughout the sprint, especially when finalizing the project idea. Everyone participated in brainstorming and agreed on the direction of the project (a budgeting app). Regular discussions on GitHub access and user story contributions helped ensure alignment.
Alex successfully created the GitHub repository and added all team members, ensuring that everyone had access. This laid the foundation for seamless collaboration moving forward.
The team successfully completed several major tasks (User stories 1, 2, and 4 were written and reviewed. The required UML diagrams (use case, sequence, and class) were created and added to the repository. The PostgreSQL database setup was initiated. These tasks helped define the project structure for future sprints.)

What could be improved: 
While Alex had no issues with accessing the repository, some team members encountered difficulties. This delay in access created minor setbacks in getting started. We should have ensured that all members were granted access to the repository sooner. In the future we should ensure every team member has access to all the tools needed to be succesful as soon as possible.

Action Items for Next Sprint: 
Alex will provide brief PostgreSQL instructions for the team.
Maintain regular communication and check-ins to stay aligned on progress.
