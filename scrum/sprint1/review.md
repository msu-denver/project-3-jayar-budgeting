# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 11/25/2024 - 7:30pm

Participants: Yedani Mendoza Gurrola, Artem Marsh, Jose Gomez Betancourt, Alexander Gonzalez Ramirez, Rhodes Ferris

Summary: 
Sprint 1 focused on laying the groundwork for the budgeting app project. The team successfully set up the GitHub repository, defined key user stories, and created important UML diagrams. The PostgreSQL database was initiated, and everyone contributed to finalizing the project idea. Despite some initial access issues with GitHub and the need for further PostgreSQL training, the team managed to complete significant milestones. By the end of the sprint, we had a strong project structure in place, with user stories 1, 2, and 4, along with the required UML diagrams, all completed. While no formal testing took place, the team verified the progress of individual components to ensure alignment with the projectâ€™s goals.

Action Items: Alex will provide brief PostgreSQL instructions for the team. More pair programming sessions or peer code reviews will also be implemented to improve code quality, promote knowledge sharing, and catch potential issues early.
