# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 12/2/2024 - 7:30pm

Participants: Yedani Mendoza Gurrola, Artem Marsh, Jose Gomez Betancourt, Alexander Gonzalez Ramirez, Rhodes Ferris

Summary: Sprint 2 focused on completing key user stories related to the budgeting app’s functionality, including user authentication. The team also made progress on Docker containerization and PostgreSQL integration. Despite some challenges, such as the technical difficulties with Docker on Artem's computer and limited time during the Thanksgiving break, the team met the primary sprint objectives and successfully delivered essential features for the project. By the end of the sprint, we had a strong project structure in place, with user stories 5, 6, and 7. Though the sprint was successful, we did face some technical challenges, including Docker issues and the limited time available for testing. However, the team managed to keep the project on track and complete the critical tasks needed for the app’s functionality.

Action Items: 
Artem will work with the team to resolve the technical issue preventing Docker from running on his computer. If necessary, the team will explore alternative solutions or configure Docker to run on a different system.
Complete and finalize the Docker files by the start of Sprint 3 to ensure smooth deployment and consistency across environments.
