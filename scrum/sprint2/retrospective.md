# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 12/2/2024 - 8:00pm

Participants: Yedani Mendoza Gurrola, Artem Marsh, Jose Gomez Betancourt, Alexander Gonzalez Ramirez, Rhodes Ferris

What Went Well:
The team did a great job of communicating, especially considering the Thanksgiving break and some team members being away, the work continued to progress well with constant updates during daily scrums.
User stories 5, 6, and 7 were completed successfully even when 6 had not originally been planned to be completed at this time.
PostgreSQL was successfully installed and integrated, allowing for smooth back-end functionality and ensuring proper data handling.
Artem made significant progress with the Docker files despite facing technical challenges. The Docker setup is nearly complete and is an essential step for containerization and deployment.

What Could Be Improved:
The Thanksgiving break led to some team members having less availability to work on the project. While this was expected, we could have better planned for these gaps by adjusting task timelines or redistributing workload.

Action Items for Next Sprint: 
Resolve Artemâ€™s Docker issues and have someone else work with him.
Test the project to ensure functionality.
